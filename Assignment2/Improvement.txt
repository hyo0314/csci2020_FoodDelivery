IMPROVEMENT ON ASSIGNMENT 2 FILE SHARING.

HYO KIM and ﻿Mohammed Savari

There are a few ways of improving this particular file sharing application. 
Instead of hard-coding the client’s folder, 
it would be better if, after running the application, 
the app has a directoryChooser that asks which directory the client would like to use. 
That way it is not only focused on one directory. 
Having subfolders would be a good idea as well since it will help optimize the content organization. 
Instead of using BufferedReader and PrintWriter to move files around, 
we could copy the file bytes to move any file type instead of just .txt or .java etc. 
The UI could be more user friendly if we were able to implement a preview method to show what the contents of the file is before uploading/downloading.
